# Observations of Ebay car sales data

The goal of this project is to clean and analyze car sales data in an exploratory manner. This information should provide value in the purchasing of a used car in the German market. The dataset is complied of used car data from eBay Kleinanzeigen (a classified section of the German eBay website). The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle by user orgesleka who is no longer active.

**OBSERVATIONS**

- Data was scrapped daily, and there was not a large descrepency for sales on any particular day.
- Some cars were listed above 350k euros, but since they were luxery brands it seemed plausible. 
- Cars listed under 100 euros were probably meant as a negoitation price and not an actual listing price.
- The most popular bin of mileage was over 150,000 kilometers
- Volkswagon was the major brand of vehicle sold with a market share over 20%
- Third most popular brand is named Opel, and sold for an average of ~3k euros.
- Avg mileage for top 5 brands ~ 130k kilometers
- Opel value drastically drops at high mileage compared to other popular brands
